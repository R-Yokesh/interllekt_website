      <p>
        Thanks for your interest in our Website at <a href="http://www.interllekt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.interllekt.com</a>. Your use of this Website, including the content, materials, and information available on or through this Website (together, the “Materials”), is governed by these Terms of Use (these “Terms”). By using this Website, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these Terms.
      </p>
      <h2 className='titlsublegl'>MATERIALS</h2>
      <p>
        ALL MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” MAY NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY PURPOSE AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. In particular, except to the extent that Materials provided through a password-protected area on this Website are subject to different rules, we make no representations or warranties with regard to the Materials’ accuracy, completeness, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular purpose. You should be aware that a significant portion of the Materials includes or consist of information that has been provided by third parties and has not been validated or verified by us. In connection with our investment activities, we often become subject to a variety of confidentiality obligations to funds, investors, portfolio companies, and other third parties. Any statements we make may be affected by those confidentiality obligations, with the result that we may be prohibited from making full disclosures. Without limitation on the effect of other warnings and disclaimers set forth in these Terms, you should interpret any statements we make (on this Website or otherwise) in that context. Please ensure that your own computer security is comprehensive and up to date. We accept no responsibility for viruses, malware or other malicious or damaging software contained in the Materials or otherwise.
      </p>
      <h2 className='titlsublegl'>THIRD-PARTY SITES</h2>
      <p>
        We accept no responsibility for third-party sites available through this Website, via hyperlink or otherwise. You are encouraged to review the terms of use applicable to those sites. Any access to, or use of, a third-party site is solely at your own risk.

      <h2 className='titlsublegl'>NO OFFER, SOLICITATION, OR ADVICE</h2>
      <p>
        Except to the extent expressly as specified by a Interllekt entity in writing, nothing on this Website is intended to constitute (i) an offer, or solicitation of an offer, to purchase or sell any security, other asset or service, (ii) investment, legal, business or tax advice or an offer to provide such advice, or (iii) a basis for making any investment decision. The Materials are provided for informational purposes and have been prepared by Interllekt for informational purposes to acquaint existing and prospective portfolio companies, entrepreneurs, and other company founders with Interllekt’s recent and historical investment activities. The Materials are not directed toward any existing or prospective investor in any Interllekt investment. The Materials are provided in summary form and do not purport to be complete. Please note that any investments or portfolio companies referenced in the Materials are illustrative and do not reflect the performance of Interllekt’s investments as a whole. The Materials do not include a complete list of all Interllekt’s portfolio companies. Past performance is not indicative of future results and there can be no assurance that any Interllekt investment will achieve comparable results or that any future investments will be profitable. All forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions that may not prove to be correct. There is no obligation for Interllekt to update or alter any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Except as expressly stated by Interllekt or its entities in writing, neither this Website nor any of the Materials make any effort to present a comprehensive or balanced description of Interllekt or its investment activities.
      </p>
      <h2 className='titlsublegl'>SUBMITTING A BUSINESS PLAN OR OTHER CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        Due to the large number of business plan ideas and related materials that we review, and the similarity of many such plans and materials, we cannot accept responsibility for protecting against misuse or disclosure of any confidential or proprietary information or other materials in the absence of our express written agreement to do so. Any plans, information, and other materials you submit in connection with this Website may be used or disclosed by us for any purpose and in any manner, as we determine in our sole discretion. Please consider this carefully before sending us any information or other materials that you deem confidential or proprietary.
